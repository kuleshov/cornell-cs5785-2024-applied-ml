    "There exist alternative version of Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB). These differ in the form they use for $P(x|y)$. Overall, Naive Bayes is a very important machine learining algorithm. Despite its simplicity, it is still used in practice because it is easy to implement, very fast to train, and produces suprisingly good performance."
